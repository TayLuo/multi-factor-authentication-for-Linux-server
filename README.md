# Multi-Factor-Authentication-for-Linux-server

Multi-factor authentication is a method of confirming your identity using at least two different ways of authentication. The most common and easiest to implement example of two-factor authentication uses a combination of passphrase and one-time-passcode generated by a special mobile app.

I will use the Google Authenticator app available for Android (in the Play Store) and iOS (in iTunes) to generate authentication codes. I will provide step by step instructions on how to set up two factor authentication with Google Authenticator.
